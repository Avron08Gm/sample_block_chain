# sample_block_chain

This respository is regarding a simple working blockchain (built in Python) which can perform bogus transactions by simulating mining. It is only intended for testing purposes.

To test it, first two servers are needed to be running locally on different ports. Ex:
AT : 'http://127.0.0.1:5000' AND 'http://127.0.0.1:5001' . (localhost).
**AND** the webapp : 'flask_app.py' should be deployed on each of these servers.
Later on, after setting up all these, the Python script : 'main_driver.py' should be executed.

All genuine pull requests are happily accepted :)
